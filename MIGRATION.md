# Migration to TypeScript

This document outlines the migration process from JavaScript to TypeScript for the Bucksy Discord bot.

## Migration Steps

1. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Updated all packages to their latest versions
   - Fixed security vulnerabilities
   - Added TypeScript and related dependencies

2. **Database Connection Pooling**
   - Implemented connection pooling for MongoDB
   - Added proper error handling
   - Created typed database operations

3. **TypeScript Setup**
   - Created tsconfig.json
   - Set up the src directory structure
   - Added type definitions

4. **Type System**
   - Created interfaces for all data structures
   - Added proper Discord.js type integration
   - Implemented generic types for better flexibility

5. **Command & Event System**
   - Converted commands to TypeScript
   - Updated event handlers to use proper types
   - Implemented better error handling

6. **Controller Implementation**
   - Implemented robust controllers for various features
   - Added proper error handling
   - Used async/await consistently

7. **Testing**
   - Set up Jest for testing
   - Created unit tests for controllers and commands
   - Added test coverage reporting

8. **Legacy Code Preservation**
   - Moved original JavaScript code to the old directory
   - Added documentation for the legacy code
   - Created a script to run the old code if needed

├── dist/           # Compiled JavaScript (generated)
└── old/            # Legacy JavaScript code
```

## Type System

The type system includes:

- **Bot Types**: Command and event interfaces
- **Database Types**: Document interfaces and operation results
- **Discord Types**: Message context and command results
- **Game Types**: Game-specific interfaces
- **Utility Types**: Common utility types

## Testing

The testing setup includes:

- **Jest**: Test runner
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript support for Jest
- **Mocks**: Mocked dependencies for isolated testing
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reporting

## Running the Code

- **TypeScript Version**: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- **Legacy Version**: `npm run start:old`

## Future Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more tests to improve coverage
2. **Slash Commands**: Implement Discord.js v14 slash commands
3. **More Features**: Add more game features and utilities
4. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation
5. **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and deployment
